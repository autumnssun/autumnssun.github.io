                    <p>We are a team of three: George Fonseka, ShuZhang, and Khoa Tran, Master of interaction design at University of Queensland. The projects is built within 3 months. We have been through a process of: Exploring the design issues, mocking up paper prototyping, reviewing user feedbacks, improve and implementing feedback to a hi-fi prototype. </p>

                        <p>We were inspired by Draw Something, a game by zynga. The game is quite simple: player picks an option, draw something to illustrate the key word, then the drawing is send to a friend. The opponent will try to guess what is the keyword, base on the drawing. </p>

                    <p>Since the beginning of the project, we wanted to build something that can be played by visual impaired people.</p>
                    <p>My initial thought was: if you want to built a game that can be played by both visual impaired and non-visual impaired people, then make it audio based. </p>
                    <p>
We made a proof of concept video: demonstrating how will the game work, with sketches on paper.</p>

                	<h1 class="emboss_2">Feedbacks</h1>
                    <p>
                    We started up with a simple interface, with large button, and high contrast colour(black and white). During the paper prototyping testing, we used the "Wizard of Oz" technique.The participant is asked to close their eyes, (since they are having good vision), we will say the buttons, or object the the user is pointing at.

                    </p>
                    <p>After testing with the paper prototype, (even though it is very low-fi). We still have very useful feedback: on navigation, selection, and activation of buttons. The proposed navigation scheme was: use finger to rub, around the screen, listen to the feedback, and activate the button, with another finger touches any where on the screen. However, this navigation scheme, is rejected by participant. They tend to double tap to activate the button. </p>
                    <p>
                    There is also problem with inputing letter, with a given set of character. Initially, we thought that It would be easier for visually impaired people since there will be less letter to deal with. However, due to the nature of navigation, it take people more time to find the right letter. Secondly, people with vision also want drag and drop the letter, which is easier for them, but for almost impossible for people who not looking at the screen to perform drag and drop. </p>
                    <p>
                    Lastly, there are also comment about the user interface. It looks boring, and plain, and not visually pleasing. It is intentionally design for people with poor vision, high contrast and  big button is important. However, we do want it looks good to non-visual impaired too. So that mean we have to redesign the interface.</p>

                     <p>At the very beginning, we picked web as the environment for our application. Since it is inclusive, so we want every body to have access to it. We spent 2 weeks, researched and developing prototype on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                     <p>After two week time, we was able to detect multitouch with javascript, so that we can support "touch to navigate" function. </p>
                     
                     <p>The prototype can be tried out at: <a href="www.deyesign.com/soundit/test.html">www.deyesign.com/soundit/test.html</a>.</p>
                     
                     
                     <p>However, we had a big issue: Recording sound in html5.  getUserMedia tag allows browser access the camera, and microphone. However, it is not widely supported on mobile, it only work on Opera Mobile 12, with android 4.1. We decided to move to Android.

                     <p>More opportunities, as well as challenges, we faced when moving to android. We started off pretty slow, since none of us had experience developing android before. However, things started to come together as we get familiar with the platform. We worked hand in hand to improve the function and the user interface at the same time. Along the way, we also having problem with android developing tools, it took me almost one week to hook up android sdk and eclipse. The built-in android simulator start up time is really long. Only one of us having a proper android phone to test the application. </p>
                     <p>Since android device's screens are very different, in term of: resolution, and size. Initially, I want to solve the problem with layout programatically using xml layout, and nesting graphic elements, however, it is quite difficult and time consuming to do that. So in the end I prepared different set of graphic elements for different resolutions.</p>
                     <p>After we have a working prototype, we gave it to some sighted user to try it, and they find it really enjoyable. However, we did not have chance to test it with visually impaired people, due to long process of ethical clearance.We would love to test it on visual impaired people in the future

                    <p>We have go through a long process of developing the application. Starting from very basic sketches of the user interface. Paper prototyping gave us a clearer insight of user need and interaction.</p>
					<p>We started off building web pages application. However we have to cancel that dues to technical difficulties.</p>
					<p>We moved to android development, with eagerness. Motivated to built some thing decent.</p> 
					<p>The very first android prototype with default android theme did not visually satisfying.</p> 
                    <p>I have tried making gradient button. However it is not really appealing yet.</p>
					<p>Choosing and appropriated font, and try to implement custom font on android phone. </p>

                     </div>
					<p>The final UI was a big improvement comparing to the sketch. </p>

					<p>The final step is optimizing UI for different devices, with different screen sizes, and resolution</p>
